 # TASK 1
 
What would be result:
Write a program to enter a 4 digit number which is 1233 from keyboard. 
Add 8 to the number and then divide it by 3. 
Now, the modulus of that number is taken with 5 
and then multiply the resultant value by 5. 
Display the final result.


# TASK 2

Suppose you entered a 6 digit number. Write a program to display a number whose digits are 2 greater than the corresponding digits of the entered number.
For example, if you entered number is 569678, then the displayed number should be 781890.


# TASK 3

Write a program to calculate the sum of the digits of a 4-digit number which is entered from keyboard. E.g.-
    INPUT : 1234        OUTPUT : 10
    
# TASK 4

Write a function that takes in a time in seconds (as an integer) and returns a string in the format "HH:MM:SS". For example, if the input is 3661, the output should be "01:01:01".

Here are some additional requirements and constraints:
1. The input time will be a non-negative integer.
2. The output should always have two digits for hours, minutes, and seconds (for example, "01" instead of "1").
